### Step 4_c Visualize How to:

# four categories:
# N+C+ : probably not truncated, pgene for another reason
# N+C- : C missing, n complete : truncated
# N-C+ : N missing, C complete: truncated
# N-C- : NC missing, likely truncated (could potentially be a pgene, look carefully)
# So start by looking at the N+ categories: hide all N-incomplete genes

# Then look at N- categories: hide all N-complete genes.

# check that things add up. Note that there may be duplicated entries, and that Human will add +1
