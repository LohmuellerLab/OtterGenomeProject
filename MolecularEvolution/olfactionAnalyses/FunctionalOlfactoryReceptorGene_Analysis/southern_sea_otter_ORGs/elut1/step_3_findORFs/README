# there is a difference between the number of ORFs in the FULLINFO and table and in the final fasta
because some sequences have gaps in them ("nnn") and so are excluded in the final script, even if an ORF is logged as being 'found'
# as  long as you discard these later it should be okay, because they won't intersect with any of your final functional ORs.
